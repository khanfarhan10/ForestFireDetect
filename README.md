# She the Force: Hack for Sustainability

## Abstract :

Monitoring and prediction proves to be seemingly important for prevention as it will help in threat
identification and better problem solving. Therefore we came up with a user-friendly monitoring
application. With this app users can monitor any particular green area in real time just by giving its
coordinates. Using Google Earth Engine we are collecting a real time data set and it will be stored in
IBM Cloud. IBM cloud is being used for its flexible interface and privacy will be maintained. Users
having unique user id and password can monitor at any instance. Also an alarm will be there to alert
in urgency.

## OBJECTIVE: 
The global climate crisis calls for an urgent action to combat the climatic change and
its impacts.Forest exploitations and forest fires on large scale contribute to the degradation of not
only land but also the climate extensively. Adhering to which, the principal intent of the project is
to develop an online platform to get real-time information about the forests in the most affected
areas of the country and avert any disastrous emergency.

## NOVELTY: 
Most forest fire control departments are informed of fires when it's already too late. For
this we introduce RTMA (Real Time Mesoscale Analysis) Data based Machine Learning. So that it
can be detected early and prevented easily. Supervising the entire area for forest fire prediction is
really challenging. So our idea will allow users for real time monitoring and predicting. Every data
will be available at the user's fingertip.

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS: 
Forest covers in India have been under threat for the past few years and
there can be numerous undeniable reasons for it. The impacts of reduction in forest covers cannot
be ignored any further. Forest fires not only cause damage to the forest and its livelihood but also
to the atmosphere releasing an abundance of harmful gases into the atmosphere which is harmful
to human health. They ultimately lead to loss of property, crops, animals, resources and people.

Loss of vegetation further causes climate change, desertification, soil erosion, floods, increase in
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and also economic hardships to those small communities
who are entirely dependent on the resources from forests.

To predict the threat at an early stage therefore we come up with a real-time monitoring web
application through which we can monitor the nearby forests and identify any alarming situation.

## PROCEDURE: 

This project is focused on a technical solution towards sustainability. Forestfire is one of
the major concerns as it is getting worse day by day. The problem with forest fires is their uncontrolled 
spreading nature and their sheer sudden eruptability. Most forest fire control departments are informed of
fires when it's already too late. For this we introduce an UI where the user will give user credentials with the
latitude & longitude of the target area. We are sending these data in the form of API with SQL queries to
Cloud. With the help of IBM Cloud these information will be stored safely. We have also created a ML
model which is capable of doing instance segmentation. This model will segregate fire in three parts on the
basis of intensity of the fire (eg.- HIGH, MODERATE, LOW). Also an alarm will be there to alert in
urgency.

## FUTURE PROSPECT:
Forest fire can occur due to either human behavior or by nature itself. Man-made causes are
reduced fairly in recent years but natural causes are quite challenging to predict beforehand.
So our idea will help users to predict and prevent fire at a very early stage. So gamaged can
be minimised and the ecosystem nurtured within it can be protected.
